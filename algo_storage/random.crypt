What put in storage/$filename.crypt or enter in stdio.
if you want to calc sequences
[ {"a": 21, "c": 1, "f": 0, "m": 100} ]
m -> needed set size
c -> constant that we need to add
a -> coefficient
also we need first value for sequence we call it f
The great thing that you may enter any amount of dictioanries with parameters
if you want to generate this values write
{ "amount": $number_of_parameters_for_sequences, "size": $size_of_sequence(m) }
